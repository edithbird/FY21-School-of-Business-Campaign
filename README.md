### List Parameters

List Description: 

By mid-June (~15th +/- a few days), could you pull and send along the following list
Prospective students
Sophs/rising juniors; jrs/rising srs (Start terms of '21 and '22)
Admitted freshman students (start term '20)
undeclared
All with home email addresses (not any that just have .maine.edu)

From Jon: Question for you regarding this request: Bullet 2 specifies that the list should include fall 2020 first year applicants who have been admitted undeclared and who have not withdrawn. Is the bullet following that section ( All with home email addresses (not any that just have .maine.edu) ) an additional criteria for bullet 2, or are we looking to pull all applicants with a home email address?

From Tracy:  HI Jon, 
That is actually a good question, as it's prompting me to rethink this. I'm reiterating the original request so we all have it in one place; Nike and Ed, there's a question below for you:
Prospective students
Sophs/rising juniors; jrs/rising srs (Start terms of '21 and '22)
Admitted freshman students (start term '20)
undeclared
All with home email addresses (not any that just have .maine.edu)
This campaign for HS students and Admitted Freshman are running July - October. 
During July and August ALL will be home. Best to have home emails.
Depending on our Fall plans, in Sept & Oct many Admitted Freshmen will be on campus (Sophs and Jrs will still be "home").
Nik & Ed - Since this is a specific audience effort and for a specific "program" - School of Business - does it make sense to target Admitted Freshmen using their .maine.edu emails addresses during Sept & Oct? Can we do that? Let me know your thoughts. Thanks!


“home” addresses

Thank you! We are also targeting Undeclared freshmen as well though. But I see your point.

Jon, we should get only the home addresses for HS students, undeclared freshman, and Transfers/Working adult inquiries. 

No ".maine.edu" addresses are needed.
